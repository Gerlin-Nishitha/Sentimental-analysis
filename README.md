# Sentimental-analysis
This project implements a real-time Sentiment Analysis application using Hugging Face Transformers and Gradio. It leverages a pre-trained NLP model (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) to classify text input as positive or negative sentiment with a confidence score. The user-friendly interface, built with Gradio, allows users to enter text and receive instant sentiment predictions. Designed for efficiency, the application can be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces and runs seamlessly on CPU or GPU. The project is lightweight, easy to set up, and ideal for real-world applications in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and text-based sentiment classification.
